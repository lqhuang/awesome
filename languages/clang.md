## Compiler beyond default Clang

- [microsoft/checkedc](https://github.com/microsoft/checkedc): Checked C is an extension to C that lets programmers write C code that is guaranteed by the compiler to be type-safe. The goal is to let people easily make their existing C code type-safe and eliminate entire classes of errors. Checked C does not address use-after-free errors. <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/checked-c>
