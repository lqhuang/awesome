### Nix

Readings

- [Flakes aren't real and cannot hurt you: a guide to using Nix flakes the non-flake way | jade's www site](https://jade.fyi/blog/flakes-arent-real/)
  - > A flake can then be relegated to merely an entry point and a way of acquiring dependencies that are required for evaluation (build-time dependencies should use `pkgs.fetchurl`, `fetchFromGitHub`, etc).
  - > I am using `package.nix` to refer to the standard way for writing packages in nixpkgs style, which are invoked with `callPackage`. This is as opposed to writing something directly in `flake.nix` using `pkgs`.
  - > Package definitions should be written with `callPackage` if possible, rather than inline in `flake.nix`, since using `package.nix` makes them into small, composable, configurable, and portable units of software.
