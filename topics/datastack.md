We highlight the differences between cloud data warehouses like Snowflake and BigQuery, legacy OLAP databases like Vertica, and a new class of real-time analytical databases like ClickHouse and StarRocks that combine elements of both of these categories. We will also examine the categories of today's analytics solutions and how to choose the right one.
