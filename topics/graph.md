## Resources

### Books

- 🌟
  [Graph Theory and Complex Networks](https://www.distributed-systems.net/index.php/books/gtcn/):
  GTCN aims to explain the basics of graph theory that are needed at an
  introductory level for students in computer or information sciences.
- [Deep Learning on Graphs](https://web.njit.edu/~ym329/dlg_book): This book
  covers comprehensive contents in developing deep learning techniques for graph
  structured data with a specific focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
- [graph-neural-networks/graph-neural-networks](https://github.com/graph-neural-networks/graph-neural-networks.github.io):
  This repo is for hosting our GNN book titled "Graph Neural Networks:
  Foundations, Frontiers, and Applications".
