    - Currently, websites have structured data (Schema.org) but no standard way for AI agents or conversational interfaces to access it.
    - NLWeb creates a standard protocol for conversational access to web content. Like RSS did for syndication, NLWeb does for AI interactions - one implementation serves both human chat interfaces and programmatic agent access.
    - The key insight: Instead of building custom NLP for every site, NLWeb leverages LLMs' existing understanding of Schema.org to create instant conversational interfaces.
