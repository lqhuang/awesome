## ???

- [microsoft/checkedc](https://github.com/microsoft/checkedc): Checked C is an
  extension to C that lets programmers write C code that is guaranteed by the
  compiler to be type-safe. The goal is to let people easily make their existing
  C code type-safe and eliminate entire classes of errors. Checked C does not
  address use-after-free errors.
